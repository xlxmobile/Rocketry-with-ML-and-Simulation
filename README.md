AeroLanding: Energy Recovery and Controlled Descent in Rocketry

Hey there! I'm a first-year master's student in Mathematics at TU Dresden, but also really interested in how it connects with science and engineering. My engineering experience might be pretty basic for now (yep, it's true 😅), but I can't help getting excited every time I see SpaceX rockets land. That's got me thinking...what if we could engineer a structure that guides rockets to land precisely where we want, using aerodynamics, and maybe even recapture some energy during the descent?🔋

I know, it might sound like a long shot, especially coming from someone who's more about equations than engines. And sure, this might even be a bit of a silly idea. But who knows? Even if it's a stretch, we might just stumble upon something interesting along the way, right? 🌟

# Project Objective🎯
The aim of AeroLanding is twofold:
1. **Design Structure**: To conceptualize and design a structure that aids in controlled descent and energy recovery during the landing of a rocket.
2. **Control Trajectory**: To devise a method to control the descent trajectory, ensuring precision and safety.

# Structure
1. **Project Documentation📄**: Here, you'll find all the details about the project's progress, design drafts, and theoretical underpinnings.
2. **Learning Resources📚**: I believe in the power of shared knowledge. As I embark on this journey, I'll be documenting and sharing all the educational materials and resources that I come across.
